# homebrew-jaikoz-tap
Homebrew tap for Jaikoz casks

The casks follow the naming convention jaikozXYZ (where X is the major version, Y the minor, and Z the micro or patch version), e.g. Jaikoz 9.3.0 would be jaikoz930.

## Installation

```console
$ brew tap eddies/jaikoz-tap
$ brew cask install jaikoz940
```
